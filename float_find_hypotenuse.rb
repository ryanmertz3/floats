# A right triangle's two shorter sides have length 2.8 and 4.5. How long is its longest side?
# Check the pythagorous.png file for the Pythagorean Theorem
#
# Your output should be a number; for example,

# 5.3
# a**2 + b**2 = c**2
a = 2.8
b = 4.5
c = ((a.to_f) ** 2) + ((b.to_f) ** 2)

p c ** (0.5)
